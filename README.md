## 📖 About The Project

This repository documents my **4-week intensive journey** into low-level programming at **42 Network**.  
The "Piscine" bootcamp challenged me to learn **C programming from scratch**, tackle real-life problems, and improve my problem-solving skills without relying on standard libraries.

## 💻 Usage

Most programs can be compiled using `gcc` with standard flags enforced by 42:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror filename.c -o output_name
```

Run the program:

```bash
./output_name
```

## 🧠 Skills Acquired

### 🛡 Hard Skills

- **Memory Management:** Stack vs Heap, manual allocation and freeing.  
- **Pointers:** Single, double pointers, arithmetic, and dereferencing.  
- **The Norm:** Strict adherence to **42 coding standard (Norminette)**.  
- **Tooling:** Vim, Git workflow, and Makefiles automation.  

### 💬 Soft Skills

- **Collaboration:** Peer-to-peer learning under strict evaluation (Moulinette).  
- **Resilience:** Debugging segmentation faults teaches patience.  
- **Time Management:** Handling multiple projects in a short, intense timeframe.

## 💭 Reflection

> *The Piscine was unlike any educational experience I've had. I went from being intimidated by a blinking terminal cursor to creating my own libraries from scratch. The greatest lesson was not the syntax of C, but the realization that I can learn anything when I break it into manageable steps and ask the right questions.*
