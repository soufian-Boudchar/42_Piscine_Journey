## 📖 About The Project

Welcome to the log of my intensive 4-week immersion into the world of low-level programming at **42 Network**. This repository documents my progress, struggles, and victories during the "Piscine" (Swimming Pool) selection bootcamp.

The goal was not just to code, but to learn **how to learn**, manage time under extreme pressure, and master the fundamentals of C without using standard libraries.

## 💻 Usage

Since 42 enforces a specific compilation flag set, most files in this repository can be compiled using `gcc` (GNU Compiler Collection).

**Standard Compilation:**

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror filename.c -o output_name
```

**Running a Program:**

```bash
./output_name
```

## 🧠 Skills Acquired

### 🛡 Hard Skills

  * **Memory Management:** Deep understanding of the Stack vs. Heap, and the responsibility of manual memory allocation.
  * **Pointers:** Mastered pointer arithmetic, dereferencing, and double pointers.
  * **The Norm:** Adapted to the strict 42 coding standard (Norminette) which enforces clean, readable architecture.
  * **Tooling:** Vim macros, Git workflow, and Makefiles.

### 💬 Soft Skills

  * **Peer-to-Peer Learning:** The "Moulinette" (grading bot) is ruthless, so relying on and helping peers was essential.
  * **Resilience:** Debugging segmentation faults for hours taught me patience and systematic problem-solving.
  * **Time Management:** Balancing multiple projects and exams in 26 days.

## 💭 Reflection

> *The Piscine was unlike any educational experience I've had. I went from being confused by a blinking terminal cursor to implementing my own string manipulation libraries from scratch. The most valuable lesson wasn't just the syntax of C, but realizing that I can learn anything if I break it down into small enough pieces and ask the right questions.*
